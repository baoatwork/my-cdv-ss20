#### [Dataset for Chinese artists on QQ Music:](https://opendata.pku.edu.cn/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18170/DVN/BJISMH)

   This dataset contains all the information of Chinese artists on QQ Music platform in 2019 including names, region comes from, and even all of their songs. Personally I like listening to music and after all, everyone likes hearing about new things about their favorite artists. I am thinking maybe I can compare different artists with each other considering years, regions and other features together to explore if I can get any interesting reults. And maybe I can visulize some typical ones and make a character choose interface out of them.

#### [Video games sales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales)

  This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies reording their rankings, platforms, publisher and so on. I think the game players definitely have already talked a lot about the rankings, and this dataset could offer great resource to a visualization camparison. Taking the publishers into consideration, we can get to know whose product works well. Taking the year of publishing into consideration, we can get to know how the game industry has developed these years.


#### [Starbucks stores in China Mainland](https://www.kaggle.com/saneryee/starbucks-stores-in-china-mainland)
  This dataset includes a record of every Starbucks store currently in mainland China in operation as of December 31, 2019. Chinese people are more and more familiar with coffee and starbucks has been kept developing fast since its entering in January 1999. It is common to see a starbucks store around the corner in Shanghai, but how about other palces in China? Maybe I can visualize the data to compare different provinces' starbucks stores including number, closetime/ opentime and other features and incorporate the visualization onto a map.
